From the home page you will see the following options:
	- Display all Http Request-Response Pairs
	- Add Or Update Http Request-Response Pairs
	- Delete Http Request-Response Pairs
	- Test API's 
	- Unit Testing Of APIs
	
The first 3 links provide normal CRUD database operations. 
As mentioned in the text you can also do the same functions using API calls with /httppair using an HTTP Request tool (cURL, HttpRequester, etc.) of your choice or...

Use the Test API's page to test /httppair and any other stored API calls.

The Unit Testing Of APIs option does unit tests for all basic CRUD operations, testing of stored and missing API calls, and testing of the different output formats.
